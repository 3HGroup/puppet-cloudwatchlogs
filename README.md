## Overview

This module installs, configures and manages the service for the AWS Cloudwatch Logs Agent on Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Red Hat & CentOS EC2 instances.

## Module Description

CloudWatch Logs can be used to monitor your logs for specific phrases, values, or patterns. For example, you could set an alarm on the number of errors that occur in your system logs or view graphs of web request latencies from your application logs. You can view the original log data to see the source of the problem if needed. Log data can be stored and accessed for as long as you need using highly durable, low-cost storage so you donâ€™t have to worry about filling up hard drives.

## Setup

### What cloudwatchlogs affects

* The `awslogs` package.
* Configuration files under `/etc/awslogs`.
* The `awslogs` service.

### Beginning with cloudwatchlogs

The minimum you need to get this module up and running is (assuming your instance is launched with a suitable IAM role):

```puppet
include '::cloudwatchlogs'
```

## Usage

In addition to the minimum config above you can also declare which logs will be shipped to Cloudwatch Logs:

```puppet
class { 'cloudwatchlogs':
  logs                  => [
    { 'Messages' => '/var/log/messages' },
    { 'Secure'   => '/var/log/secure' },
    { 'Mail'     => '/var/log/maillog' },
  ],
  region                => 'eu-west-1',
  aws_access_key_id     => 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',
  aws_secret_access_key => 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',
}
```
